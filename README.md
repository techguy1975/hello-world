# hello-world  
I am a retire college professor teaching Business Management and Computer Systems.  I am A+ and Net+ Certified and have programmed, built and operated computers since the 80's when the TRS-80 computer came out.  I actually took Fortran IV at Georgia Tech in 1971!  So, I enjoy computers and using them to do neat things.
The project I am working on now is to take a high quality photo of a large city clock tower and displaying it on a 15" digital photo frame (or larger) with the clock faces actually working and keeping local time.
I have many and far-ranging interests: Photography, music, videography, computers, drones, RC devices, sports cars, motorcycles, cooking, android, and dementia (my wife currently suffers from the degenerative disease).
